## This project is still in BETA

This is a filament cutter designed around the Xol 2 platform a lot of the documentation is in beta and so is the project, just trying to get it to github for an easier way to distribute it. I'm a noob when it comes to doing anything on github so bear with me lol.






So far the project supports the following hotends and extruders with more to come!

### Hotends

- Dragon SF/UHF/ACE
- Rapido SF/UHF
- Revo Voron
- Bambu Labs *In BETA since official XOL 2 doesn't really support it yet*

### Extruders

- [Wrist Watch 2](https://github.com/tetsu97/WristWatch-G2-Extruder)
- [Sherpa Mini](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder)
- [Orbiter](https://www.orbiterprojects.com/orbiter-v2-0/)
- [G2SA](https://github.com/tetsu97/Galileo2)

| 3   | M3 Heatset Insert   | 5mm Outer Diameter x 4mm Length `Standard Voron spec`                                         |
| 3   | M2.5 Heatset Insert | 3.5mm Outer Diameter x 4mm Length `Same as Xol 2 BOM`                                         |
| 3   | M2 Heatset Insert   | 3.5mm Outer Diameter x 4mm Length `Same as Xol 2 BOM`                                         |
| 3   | M2x8 SHCS           | To hold the extruder adapter together.                                                        |
| 1   | 5.5mm Ball Bearing  | For toolhead filament sensor. `Same as ERCF BOM`                                              |
| 1   | D2F-5L Micro Switch | Tis be switch that does clicky things.                                                        |

| Yes | PTFE Tube           | Still working out exact lengths and possibly cutting jigs.                                    |

## The build

On top of the build of Xol 2 follow this [Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SKAF6VHhXhA64Z4uIKywSt5jq5D0fDKbgyQrExmpVV8/edit) to put the cutter together.

There is a blade jig in the STL folder that you just place the blade cutting side into it then clamp it down with M2 screws or other means and then use pliers to snap the blade close to the printed part. Sand if needed.
